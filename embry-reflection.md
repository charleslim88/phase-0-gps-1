# Reflection #
1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	Just the order of things, but Charles and Ryan both helped make me feel comfortable.
2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	Again, the order of how things work without having to constantly refer back to the lessons or previous code.
3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	If I forgot any commands, I first referred to Charles but if the concept was entirely new such as merge conflict, Ryan was great to refer back to. 
4. What still confuses you about Git?
	I think just the whole flow of Git is confusing but I know with more practice it will become second nature.
5. How was your first experience of pair in a GPS?
	I was incredibly nervous! I think after that went away, my ability to actually remember and implement what I learned was easier.
